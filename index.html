	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
			<p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.</p>
			<p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

			<h3>Randy's Profile</h3>
			<p>My name is Randy Le and I am currently student s3922276 at RMIT University studying in my first year of a Bachelor of Information Technology. I am currently in the class Introduction to Information Technology in a group called Team Bruh. I graduated from Year 12 last year from Victoria University Secondary College and finished VCE with an ATAR of 76. I am an Australian citizen and I was born at Monash Hospital Moorabbin on the 13th of September 2002. I live in a Vietnamese household and my family is Buddhist. A hobby of mine is that I enjoy playing games especially first-person shooters such as Valorant which brought my interest to IT because I would like to understand deeper than what appears on my screen and how everything works. I currently have no experience in IT besides when I learn computing in year 11 and everything else that I have learnt during university.</p>

			<h3>Wendy's Profile</h3>
			<p>Hello, My name is Wendy Si and my student number is s3898700. I am from Shanghai, but was born and raised in Melbourne. My date of birth is the 8th of February 2003 and my background is Chinese. I graduated from Nossal High School in 2020 and am now a first year Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I can speak English and Mandarin Chinese, and can understand Shanghainese. A fun fact about me is that I used to be a state level swimmer when I was around 10 years old. My hobbies are playing video games, reading manga, watching anime, going clubbing and going out with friends. My interest in Information Technology is mainly centred around the coding aspect, I am interested in creating programs and learning the languages. I like how Information Technology is very practical as well, with getting the opportunity to make things. This allows me to implement what I’ve learnt and be able to create projects and sharpen my skills. My experience in Information Technology is very minimal. I learnt enough HTML to build a website back in 2017 and completed an online course in Python 2 in 2018, however those skills are long forgotten as I haven’t retained my knowledge from that time. </p>

			<h3>Margaret's Profile</h3>
			<p>Hi, I'm Margaret and I'm an Australian born Chinese. I'm bilingual, speaking both English and Chinese. I have a pet cockatiel which I adore and her name is Jett. She's named after an agent in my favourite video game at the moment, Valorant. My interests in I.T. sparked when I was struggling to find a career path I'd be happy to pursue along with my studies. I have had a passion for computer systems and gaming for a number of years now which would naturally steer me toward I.T. What makes me more interested in this field is the evolving nature of it. Especially in the face of COVID-19, we can see how workers in the technology field are needed more than ever to facilitate virtual connection in a social distancing world. I'm currently in my first year of studying for my Bachelor of I.T. Degree. </p>

			<h3>Lachlan's Profile</h3>
			<p>Hey, I’m Lachlan and I’m in my final semester of my program at RMIT, looking towards mechanical engineering and branching out into an IT-based pathway. I grew up in the rural countryside of Victoria, having ventured into the city after graduating high school and going into university, at least up until the outbreak of the recent pandemic. My interest in IT is mainly from wanting to go further into my prior work with site languages such as HTML and Javascript, which was built further from my university program’s use of the C and Java languages. I want to expand my knowledge when it comes to my engineering coursework and use it as well as my ability to write, modify and maintain my coding in order to ensure everything works right, making sure to remain versatile in the fields of computer science and mechanical or mechatronic engineering and look promising to employers as I make my way out.</p>

			<h3>IT WORK</h3>
			<p>Michelle from Energy Australia works as a project analyst. Her responsibilities are to manage two time shooting systems, which includes providing support to users, managing any queries that they have, provide training and support. Furthermore, another role which she has is reporting such as data analysis on HR data as well as financial reporting for the budget of the department's trainings. 

Energy Australia is a provider and seller of electricity and gas. Their headquarters is in Melbourne which is where the contact center is run to help provide customer support. Through the pandemic, Energy Australia was able to cope and keep providing through having great culture which thrives on mental health and wellbeing and so they provide extra support to workers to help them push themselves and keep going. Each employee has two recharge days per year which allows them to take the day off and to basically recharge by having a short break. The work schedule is very flexible and so workers are able to choose times in which they work. Work has shifted to online because during the pandemic the office is closed and so everyone is working remotely and they are able to interact through Microsoft Teams and meetings where the workers cameras are turned on which allows them to interact easily. 

During work Michelle interacts with stakeholders and system users such as project coordinators. She also interacts with financial coordinators because with the time shooting system the projects are charging money and so there are talks with the accounting team. Furthermore, meetings are ran with internal workers such as work colleagues with cameras on because it enhances their connections. They prefer to interact in an online meeting or call rather than messaging because work can get lost easily. 

Most of Michelle’s day is spent generally on queries from users. However, if she is unable to help the user with a query because she doesn’t have specific access to information, she contacts the technical team to help resolve issues. These external people tend to be overseas and so she is required to keep in mind the time difference in order to ask for support. 

A challenging part of her work is that it can be frustrating because there may be many deadlines or unresolved issues which requires her to contact many different teams to help resolve the issue.</p>
			
			<h3>Cloud</h3>
			<p>Cloud is an external storage system which allows users to store data on a remote database which can be accessed from many different devices. These cloud storages tend to be safe and secure which allows its users to have an extra space to be used as a backup in case any data is lost. Data is shared and stored onto a cloud drive which allows the information to be used and maintained by different users. This is safer than saving information onto a hard drive because if the hard drive is lost then all of the data is gone however if data is saved onto a cloud, then is backed up in another location. Examples of cloud storages could be Dropbox or Google Drive which allows users to pay a monthly rate in exchange for an external storage space. Cloud Storage can vary depending on the user. For example, a user is able to have up to 2 GB of free storage on Dropbox and this can vary to unlimited amounts of spaces for the user depending on how much storage is needed.</p>
			<p>A likely impact is that most users would tend to turn to cloud storage as it allows for them to have an external space to save all of their data. This allows for the data to be backed up which means that they don’t have to risk losing all of their information on a hard drive. Furthermore, through a cloud the user is able to access information from many other devices whilst also allowing for their personal device to have extra storage for other necessities. It is also a cheaper option for big companies as they are able to buy unlimited storage on a cloud rather than having to spend money on multiple hard drives which can be easily lost or damaged compared to an external storage which is accessed online. Data is safely stored and encrypted on an offsite location meaning that companies won't have to worry about information being easily accessed by external users however for themselves they are easily able to access the data. However, a problem with the cloud is that users rely on the cloud provider to provide efficient security measures so that data isn't deleted or stolen. 
 
Cloud storages would have an effect on me personally because they would be used as an external source for me to store any data that I need to store. Dropbox was chosen for cloud storage as there is a 180 day history recovery period, so if a file is overridden by a new version it can still be recovered up to half a year later. It offers compression free file upload, meaning file quality would remain the same. Dropbox also offers 100 GB file upload and is only $10 a month per TB. It is also extremely reliable as it generally remains online 24/7 for 365 days excluding server update periods. </p>
